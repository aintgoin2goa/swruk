			<h1>CRISIS</h1>
			<h3>Why We're here</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This is the worst refugee crisis since WWII.</li>
				<li>Refugees are risking their lives to seek safety. Almost 2,700 have lost their lives in the Mediterranean this year.</li>
				<li>The British Government’s response is inadequate. 4,000 annual resettlement places have been offered - 12 people per day - for five years.</li>

		<h1>CAMPAIGN</h1>
		<h3>Solutions we can campaign for:</h3>
		<p>
			The organisations supporting this march have a range of campaigns. Here are four fundamental starting points:
		</p>
		<ol>

			<li>The UK should take a fair and proportionate share of refugees, both those already within the EU and those still outside it.</li>
			<li>Safe and legal routes to the UK, as well as to the EU, need to be established. Such routes ought to include:
				<ol>
					<li>Humanitarian visas – that is to say visas for the specific purpose of seeking asylum on arrival – issued in the country of departure or intended embarkation.</li>
					<li>Resettlement schemes, accepting refugees directly from the country of persecution or from neighbouring states.</li>
					<li>Humane family reunion policies, such as allowing child refugees in the UK to be joined by adult family members.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Safe and legal routes within the EU, including the UK, should be established. For instance:
				<ol>
					<li>A relocation scheme to take refugees from destitute conditions elsewhere in Europe;</li>
					<li> A suspension of the ‘Dublin’ system, save for the purpose of family reunification. </li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				There should be access to fair and thorough procedures to determine eligibility for international protection wherever it is sought.
			</li>
		</ol>
