				We are the organisers of the  <b>'Solidarity with Refugees' demonstration</b>

				that drew <b>90,000 people</b> to march through central London this Saturday

				12th September.  Thousands more were involved in simultaneous

				demonstrations in support of refugees in Belfast, Manchester, Bristol,

				Leeds, Birmingham, Brighton, York, Falmouth, Newcastle, Liverpool,

				Cardiff, Glasgow, Swansea, Barnsley, Bradford, Huddersfield, Sheffield,

				Wakefield, Aberystwyth, Coventry, Exeter, Chester, Newcastle, and

				Stirling.
			</p>
			<p>
				The clear message of these demonstrations - and the myriad petitions

				calling on the Government to accept its moral and legal obligations

				towards refugees - is that:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The 20,000 resettlement places so far offered (over a five year

					period and not for those already seeking refuge in Europe)- some

					12 places per day- is far too little, and far too slow, for the

					magnitude and urgency of the unprecedented global refugee crisis.</li>

				<li>The Government’s message to date that offering more resettlement

					or relocation places will ‘pull’ people to risk their lives on the

					Mediterranean convinces no-one. The evidence is overwhelming

					that the situation in the main countries of origin – Syria, Eritrea -

					and in refugee camps in surrounding countries- is so horrifying,

					and constitutes so compelling a ‘push’ factor that no ‘pull’ is

					needed. Families with war or totalitarian repression at their backs

					will continue to risk their lives- and many more will die- until the

					EU, including Britain, offers safe and legal routes to reach the EU.</li>

				<li>Reception conditions at Europe’s peripheries- in particular

					Hungary and Greece, are so poor or have deteriorated to such an

					extent that it is indefensible to seek to enforce (save for the

					purposes of family reunification) the ‘Dublin’ system of forcing

					asylum seekers back to the country through which they first

					entered the EU.</li>

				<li>A significant portion of the public, far from being attracted by the

					dog-whistle, toxic language used by some members of the

					Government to describe refugees ('a swarm') are ashamed of it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We expect more from Britain and better from our Government.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why we call on the British Government to take responsibility at

				the EU Emergency Talks on 14 September. A viable and humane solution

				must meet the following four criteria:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Britain must take a fair and proportionate share of refugees.</b></li>
				<li><b>Safe and legal routes into the EU.</b>  For example, humanitarian

					visas (visas to travel to claim asylum) and humane family

					reunion policies.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Safe and legal routes inside the EU for asylum seekers.</b> For

					example, an end to the dysfunctional ‘Dublin’ system of

					pushing asylum seekers back to the poorer countries on

					Europe’s peripheries.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Free movement of recognised refugees within the EU.</b> This

					would help reunite families and prevent asylum seekers and

					refugees from risking their lives crossing Europe clandestinely.
				</li>
			</ol>
